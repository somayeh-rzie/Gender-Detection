# About This Project
One of the most difficult tasks in the classroom, especially online classes, is to use the prefixes Mr. and Ms. correctly.<br />
We created a gender detection website that sends an http request to 'https://api.genderize.io/?name=$username'
then gets a JSON prediction response.<br />
User can save or delete gender they want whether they consider our prediction or not!<br />
We were not allowed to use any libraries or frameworks in this project therefore it has a super simple code:))
